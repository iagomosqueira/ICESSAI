Why programming?
==========

“Can one be a good data analyst without being a half-good programmer? The short answer to that is, ‘No’. The long answer to that is, ‘No!’.”

– Frank Harrell, 1999 S-PLUS User Conference, New Orleans (October 1999)

But this should be easy
===========

"Managing fisheries is hard: it’s like managing a forest, in which the trees are invisible and keep moving around"

- Professor John Shepherd

What is R
==========

\centerline{\includegraphics[height=1in]{graphics/Rlogo.png}}

* Data analysis and statistics environment
* Interpreted computer language
* Open-source software project
* Active community of developers and practicioners
* Current version:  3.1.1 (2014-07-10) -- "Sock it to Me"

Why R?
==========
## R is
- awesome
- free (both speech and beer)
- a community
- the *lingua franca*
- a language and an environment
- integrates with other tools
- a way to reproducible research

OSS = Peer review
==========

RStudio
===========

Basic features
==========

* Numerous procedures (algebra, matrix, stats)
* Named storage (everything is an object)
* Functions
* Classes and methods (S3, S4)
* Special values (`NA, NaN, Inf, NULL`)
* Logical objects and boolean algebra
* `basic_features.R`

What else can it do?
==========

* Data handling and storage
* Matrix algebra
* Regular expressions
* Statistics!
* OOP
* Programming
* Graphics

What doesn't it do
===========

* No DB, but connections (SQL, NoSQL, Spreadsheets)
* No GUI, but IDE & GUI toolsets - CLI
* Slow, but C/C++, HPC
* No commercial support, but community
* Think for you

Help!
==========

* Help for each function and data type
* ?mean
* ??mean
* ?help
* http://rseek.org
* stackoverflow, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r
* Mailing lists

FLR
==========

* Stock assessment and provision of management advice
    * Well tested, robust methods
    * Open to detailed inspection
* Data and model validation through simulation
* Risk analysis
* Capacity development & education
* Promote collaboration and openness in quantitative fisheries science
* Support the development of new models and methods
    * Extensible toolset
    * Links to other tools (ADMB, BUGS, ...)
